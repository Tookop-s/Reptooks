Minishell : 

- display a prompt when waiting for a new cmd
- have a working history 
- search and laucnh the right executable based on the path or using relative/absolute path
- use only one global variable to receive a signal
- do not handle unclosed quotes or special characters ( \ ;)
- handle ' ' wich prevent the shell from interpreting any metacharacter inside the quotes
- handle " " wich prevent the shell from interpreting any metacharacter inside the quotes except for $
- implement redirections :
	◦ < should redirect input.
	◦ > should redirect output.
	◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
	delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
	◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.
- implement pipe | 
- handle environment variables ($PATH)
- handle $? echo the the status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline on the terminal
- handle CTRL-C CTRL-D CTRL-\ (behave like in bash) :
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
- implement the following builtins :
	◦ echo with option -n
	◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
	◦ pwd with no options
	◦ export with no options
	◦ unset with no options
	◦ env with no options or arguments
	◦ exit with no options
readline() is leaking but no leak from our code is tolerated 


Bonus 
- implement &&  and  || with parenthesis for priorities 
- wildcards * should work for the current directory
